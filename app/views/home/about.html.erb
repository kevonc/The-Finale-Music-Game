  <h1>The Finale Mission</h1>

  <p>What genre of music do you like? My personal favorites are Electronic, Trance and House. Though I spend the majority of my time on these genres, I enjoy exploring music in all kinds.</p>

  <p>This is my first hacking project in Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. I wanted to build a game for everyone to explore new music while having fun, and The Finale was born!</p>

  <p>This site is built with Ruby on Rails, Coffee Script, and Soundcloud API.</p>

  <p>I hope you enjoy the game and learn to appreciate music created by anyone.</p>
